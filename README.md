# [RETROFIT](http://retrograde.space)

Rome wasn't built in a day; your stylesheet shouldn't be either.

## Why should I use this instead of x framework?

We believe that a stylesheet isn't something you build, or download in a day. If you want something that is truly lightweight (under 5kb minified) that only gives you the basics, then RETROFIT is for you.

## Get started

**Install with npm**

```sh
$ npm install --save retrofitcss
```

**Link to it**

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://retrograde.space/dist/retrofit.min.css"/>
```
